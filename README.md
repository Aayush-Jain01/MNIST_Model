# MNIST_Model
This repo is a model trained to predict images of hand-written digits contained in the MNIST database.It is a basic code designed to be a self-project based on logistic regression and implemented using PyTorch and numpy. The accuracy achieved is upto **92%** depending on how much you train the model, it can be improved using complex learning techiniques like deep neural networks.
