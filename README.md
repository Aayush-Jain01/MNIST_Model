# MNIST_Model
This repo is a model trained to predict images of hand-written digits contained in the MNIST database.It is a basic code designed to be a self-project based on logistic regression and implemented using PyTorch and numpy. The accuracy achieved is **87-89%** with 10-20 epochs and upto **92%** with larger epochs(this process can be speeded up if you simply use a neural network with a hidden layer but without any activation function).  
However using a Neural network with hidden layer of size **32** and activation function **ReLU** an accuracy of upto **97%** is achieved.The accuracy can be increased even further but that would require complex learning techniques like CNN.
